# TrainTime
Welcome to my TrainTime project. This project highlights the use of Firebase for realtime data storage as well as the use of the Moment.js library to assist with figuring time, i.e. next arrival time of trains and minutes until the next train will arrive.

One of my favorite train stations I have ever visited is in Guldager, Denmark. It is just outside the main city of Esberg. So I chose to use a picture of that train station as my header. The rest of the design is very simple to make it easier to read the train times.

The name of the train, destination, how often it runs, the next arrival time and minutes to next arrival all display. And the current time runs continuously. However, I am continuing to work on getting the next arrival time and minutes to arrival to update every minute. As of right now, that feature is not working.
